## KMFX-scripts

KMFX scripts is an ongoing collaboration of visual effects artists in the creation of
custom scripts for Silhouette FX software to enhance workflows for Roto, Paint, Tracking
and Compositing. It is our wish that these scripts are shared, implemented and built
upon by anyone.


We also have a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/kmfx-rotopaint) where questions can be addressed and artists and developers
can collaborate further.
