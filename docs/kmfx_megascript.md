## KMFX_megascript Documentation

Megascript is a script that the user can copy and paste into a Silhouette Script Editor Window and execute it.  This is for Silhouette versions v2022.5 and upwards.
This script allows for flexibility and also no reliance on a start up script, or an external user_keybinds.py file.

Notes:
 - users can comment out scripts they do not want
 - users can change keybind assignments to their liking
 - changes are not permanent as when Silhouette closes, the scripts will no longer be executed
 - there are no KMFX preferences
