## KMFX_paintsubpixeloff Documentation

This script allows you have Subpixel automatically disabled for the Clone Brush in the Paint node.

Steps: 

1. Go to KMFX Preferences and check "Disable Clone subpixel".

Note: One can still turn on Subpixel in the Clone Brush window. However, after turning it on, then clicking another node and then clicking
back to the Paint node, Subpixel is subsequently disabled again.


- Can be run from KMFX menu: NO
- Can be run from keybind: NO
