## KMFX_copyShapeKeyframe Documentation

This script lets the user copy a shape that is animated, or not, to another frame in the timeline.  For Silhouette versions v2022.5 and upwards.

Use the assigned hotkey shortcut (Cmd+Shift+c) to copy a keyframe, then go to another point in the timeline 
and use the assigned hotkey shortcut to paste it (Cmd+Shift+v).

Notes:
The script just copies the shape of the shape and not any other parameters in the Object window.
It will copy the selected shapes.
It does not matter if the whole shape is selected, even one point is OK.

- Can be run from KMFX menu:  YES
- Can be frun from keybind:  YES
